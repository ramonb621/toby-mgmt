# WELCOME TO TOBY MANAGEMENT

## PURPOSE:

For startup companies and established small businesses, handling their employees’ information can be a challenging task that often presents information security concerns. While numerous software tools exist on the market today, many would not fit into the budget of a startup or small business, nor provide the right suite of features they may need. 

Toby Management provides a solution to this problem by allowing users to manage all of their employees’ information in one convenient location. By creating a Toby account, Owners, Executives, and/or Human Resource Managers can create profiles for their employees, enter personal information, and even upload photos and essential documents.
